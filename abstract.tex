%To explore how the brain may recognise objects in its general,accurate and energy-efficient manner, this paper proposes the use of a neuromorphic hardware system formed from a Dynamic Video Sensor~(DVS)
%silicon retina in concert with the SpiNNaker real-time Spiking Neural
%Network~(SNN) simulator.
%As a first step in the exploration on this platform a recognition system for dynamic hand postures is developed, enabling the study of the methods used in the visual pathways of the brain.
%Inspired by the behaviours of the primary visual cortex, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are modelled using both linear perceptrons and spiking Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons.

%In this study's largest configuration using these approaches, a network of 74,210 neurons and 15,216,512 synapses is created and operated in real-time using 290 SpiNNaker processor cores in parallel and with 93.0\% accuracy.
%A smaller network using only 1/10th of the resources is also created,
%again operating in real-time, and it is able to recognise the postures
%with an accuracy of around 86.4\% - only 6.6\% lower than the much larger system.
%The recognition rate of the smaller network developed on this neuromorphic system is sufficient for a successful hand posture recognition system, and demonstrates a much improved cost to performance trade-off in its approach.

The brain recognises huge amount of objects rapidly and effortlessly even in cluttered and natural scenes.
While the major stumbling crux of the computer object recognition systems lies in the invariance problem.

To explore the invariant object recognition of the brain in a biologically plausible way is the right place to tackle the computational difficulty;
in turn it also contribute to the understanding of biological visual processing by means of mimicking the neural activities in the visual systems.

As a first step in the exploration, a recognition system for dynamic hand postures is developed on the bespoken platform.
It enables the study of the methods used in the ventral visual pathway of the primate brain.
Inspired by the behaviours of the primary visual cortex, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are modelled using both linear perceptrons and spiking Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons.

The future work is proposed to built an object recognition system with position, scale and view invariance by mimicking the neurons along the ventral stream.
