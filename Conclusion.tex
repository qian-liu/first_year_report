%Motivation
To explore how brain may recognise objects in its general, accurate and energy-efficient manner, this paper proposes the use of a neuromorphic hardware system which includes a DVS retina connected to SpiNNaker, a real-time SNN simulator.
%Problem
Building a recognition system based on this bespoke hardware for dynamic hand postures is a first step in the study of visual pathway of the brain.
%Methods
Inspired by the structures of the primary visual cortex, convolutional neural networks are modelled using both linear perceptrons and LIF neurons.
%Results
The larger network of 74,210 neurons and 15,216,512 synapses runs smoothly in real-time on SpiNNaker using 290 cores within a 48-node board.
The smaller network using 1/10 of the resources is able to recognise the postures in real-time with an accuracy about 86.4\% in average, which is 
only 6.6\% lower than the former but with a better cost/performance ratio.
%In this paper, we implement a dynamic hand posture recognition system running completely on a hardware neuromorphic platform.
%The SNN based classifier is able to recognise moving hand postures instead of static digit or face recognition proposed before.
%The network model is translated from linear perceptrons to LIF spiking neurons with a 10\% drop of accuracy in 30~ms windowing;
%while the performance reaches and even exceeds the perceptrons version when the window length is set to 300~ms.
%Various network sizes are configured to explore the cost and performance trade-off.
%In the tests of linear perceptrons the recognition rate of the smaller network is \% lower for the template matching model and \% lower for the trained MLP model.
%For the SNN based real-time experiments, both the larger network with $74,320$ LIF neurons and $15,216,512$ synapses, and the smaller network with 1/10 of the neurons and 1/50 of the synapses run smoothly on SpiNNaker.
%The gap of recognition rate narrows when the spiking rate is sampled into wider frame of 300~ms.
%The recognition rates of both linear perceptrons (\%) and spiking neurons (\%) with 32 $\times$ 32 input resolution are adequate for the recognition of the moving hand postures.
%This work is a good attempt to start exploring the visual process of the brain.

%Later, we will look more into the overall network latency, which could be due to the system latency and the performance of the rate coding.  
The future work on this topic will include further collaboration with biologists and neuroscientists working on vision systems, especially concentrating on the orientation detection region of the brain.
To equip the system with tracking is another importance direction for future development where the recognition performance can be increased by exploiting short-term memory of a gesture's route.
Using the approch of HMMs~\cite{elmezain2009hidden} and applying to spiking neural networks is an idea we wish to explore as part of this promising work.
%Using the idea of HMMs~\cite{elmezain2009hidden} to spiking neural networks may be a good approach.
